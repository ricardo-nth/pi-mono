# Development Rules

## First Message
If the user did not give you a concrete task in their first message,
read README.md, then ask which module(s) to work on. Based on the answer, read the relevant README.md files in parallel.
- packages/ai/README.md
- packages/tui/README.md
- packages/agent/README.md
- packages/coding-agent/README.md
- packages/mom/README.md
- packages/pods/README.md
- packages/web-ui/README.md

## Code Quality
- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Check node_modules for external API type definitions instead of guessing
- **NEVER use inline imports** - no `await import("./foo.js")`, no `import("pkg").Type` in type positions, no dynamic imports for types. Always use standard top-level imports.
- NEVER remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated dependencies; upgrade the dependency instead
- Always ask before removing functionality or code that appears to be intentional

## Commands
- After code changes (not documentation changes): `npm run check` (get full output, no tail). Fix all errors, warnings, and infos before committing.
- NEVER run: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm test`
- Only run specific tests if user instructs: `npm test -- test/specific.test.ts`
- NEVER commit unless user asks

## GitHub Issues
When reading issues:
- Always read all comments on the issue

When creating issues:
- Add `pkg:*` labels to indicate which package(s) the issue affects
  - Available labels: `pkg:agent`, `pkg:ai`, `pkg:coding-agent`, `pkg:mom`, `pkg:pods`, `pkg:tui`, `pkg:web-ui`
- If an issue spans multiple packages, add all relevant labels

When closing issues via commit:
- Include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the commit message
- This automatically closes the issue when the commit is merged

## Tools
- GitHub CLI for issues/PRs
- Add package labels to issues/PRs: pkg:agent, pkg:ai, pkg:coding-agent, pkg:mom, pkg:pods, pkg:tui, pkg:web-ui
- TUI interaction: use tmux

## Style
- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text
- Technical prose only, be kind but direct (e.g., "Thanks @user" not "Thanks so much @user!")

## Changelog
Location: `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` (each package has its own)

### Format
Use these sections under `## [Unreleased]`:
- `### Breaking Changes` - API changes requiring migration
- `### Added` - New features
- `### Changed` - Changes to existing functionality
- `### Fixed` - Bug fixes
- `### Removed` - Removed features

### Rules
- Before adding entries, read the full `[Unreleased]` section to see which subsections already exist
- New entries ALWAYS go under `## [Unreleased]` section
- Append to existing subsections (e.g., `### Fixed`), do not create duplicates
- NEVER modify already-released version sections (e.g., `## [0.12.2]`)
- Each version section is immutable once released

### Attribution
- **Internal changes (from issues)**: `Fixed foo bar ([#123](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/123))`
- **External contributions**: `Added feature X ([#456](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/456) by [@username](https://github.com/username))`

## Releasing

1. **Update CHANGELOGs**: Ensure all changes since last release are documented in the `[Unreleased]` section of each affected package's CHANGELOG.md

2. **Run release script**:
   ```bash
   npm run release:patch    # Bug fixes
   npm run release:minor    # New features
   npm run release:major    # Breaking changes
   ```

The script handles: version bump, CHANGELOG finalization, commit, tag, publish, and adding new `[Unreleased]` sections.

### **CRITICAL** Tool Usage Rules **CRITICAL**
- NEVER use sed/cat to read a file or a range of a file. Always use the read tool (use offset + limit for ranged reads).
- You MUST read every file you modify in full before editing.
